Dragonite is a (yet another, but one of the few that are being actively developed) reliable application level data transport protocol (and implementation) based on UDP.

**It is designed to be fast - even in extremely unstable networks, flexible - with lots of adjustable parameters, and easy to use - implemented in Socket-like APIs.**

## Notice

- The project has not yet been completed, expect major bugs
- Dragonite has no built-in congestion control algorithms so it is not TCP-friendly
